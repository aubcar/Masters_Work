#Computational Identification of Structural Variants in Macaque

##Goals 
  * Use whole genome sequences to computationally identify and analyse structural varients in two species of hybridising macaques.
  * Combine all SV outputs into one high quality list 
  * Diversity and divergence scan to identify divergent regions between the species
  * Gene ontology analysis of Divergent regions
  * Differential gene expression analysis of divergent regions 

####Samples:
A 5-year-old female CR macaque and a 4-year-old female CE macaque of Vietnamese origin were used in this study. The CR macaque individual was descended from an individual captured from the wild in Yunnan Province. The origins of these two individuals were confirmed by mitochondrial DNA sequencing. Genomic DNA was collected from the peripheral blood cells of these two individuals.
